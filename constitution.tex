            \item The initial phase for any project will consist of forming a document describing the \bb{objectives} of the project, meaning what \bb{functionality} will the final product serve. This document must also be detailed with respect to how the \bb{end user experience} of the product will be. It is essential that these points in this document are kept in mind during the entire course of development. Inputs from all members of the club are welcome for this part. 
            \item The concerned teams will then decide on the \bb{actual implementation} of the project , which includes things like agreeing on the tech stack to be used for the project, the division of work into modules, and a Plan of Action  for the project. Each major decision regarding the implementation will be well documented, including the \bb{Plan of Action} and the \bb{timeline} decided for the work.
            \item Each team will consist of 1-2 heads responsible for coordinating the work assigned to the team and communicating with other teams as work progresses. There will be a dedicated git repository for each module that is handled by a team. The code should be modularised and commented/documented in a manner that another member can join in and contribute even mid-way during a project.
            \item There shall be scheduled Full Team Meetings. Each team shall have to showcase the work done since the last such meeting. Such Team Meetings shall be utilised to discuss the further course of action and reviews about the work done till then.

In such a scenario, the concerned member will not be eligible for the monetary compensation.
                  \end{itemize}
      \end{enumerate}
\chapter{Amendments to the Constitution}

      The constitution may be subjected to future amendments in order to be flexible with the current needs and requirements. Any generic amendment to the constitution must be proceeded in the following format:
      \begin{enumerate}
            \item The Core Team shall hold a meeting for the passing amendment and put to vote the clauses of the amendment. 
            \item The Amendment shall be deemed to be passed if the amendment receives more than fifty percent of the full capacity of the core team present during the time of voting.
            \item A proper draft of the amendment shall be sent to all of the teams, before the amendment is put to vote, either over mail or in writing, whichever may seem suitable to the Secretary of the core team.
            \item Any change to the amendment, proposed by any of the teams shall be entertained by the core team only until the amendment is not put to vote. Once an amendment is passed, any other change can be brought about only by the means of another amendment.
      \end{enumerate}
            Besides the above requirement, any amendment changing the structure of the organisation, which includes the election method, addition in the team, changes in the objectives, method of amendments, must necessarily require the consent of the President.
